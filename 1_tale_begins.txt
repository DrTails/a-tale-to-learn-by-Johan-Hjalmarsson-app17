Once uppon a time there was a far away land where friendly farmers and laugning children
lived their peaceful lives in the calm of the protecting walls of the great mountain Reqiex.
Inside this big mountain, there were a large, complex, tunnel system where the citizens could
walk in different directions to reach all the cities that were placed all over the mountain.
